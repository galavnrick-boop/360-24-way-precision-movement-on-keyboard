ðŸŽ® Controls in Your Script
Movement Keys

The script lets you move in 24 directions (every 15Â° on a circle), instead of just the usual 8-way (WASD + diagonals).

W â†’ Up (north)

S â†’ Down (south)

A â†’ Left (west)

D â†’ Right (east)

ðŸ‘‰ You can combine keys (like W+A for up-left, or S+D for down-right).
The script automatically normalizes the vector so you move at the correct angle.

Tilt Modifiers

This is what gives you the extra in-between angles (24 total).

C â†’ Tilt clockwise (+)

V â†’ Tilt counter-clockwise (â€“)

How it works:

If you just hold a direction key (like A left), youâ€™ll get the standard 8-way angle.

If you hold C or V while pressing a direction, it tilts that direction by Â±20Â°.

If you press both C and V in sequence, you can get double tilt (Â±40Â°).

Example:

A â†’ Left (180Â°)

A + C â†’ Tilted left (160Â°)

A + V â†’ Tilted left (200Â°)

A + C then V â†’ Double tilt left (140Â° or 220Â°, depending on order)

This is how you go from 8 base angles â†’ 24 total movement directions.

HUD (On-Screen Display)

A small transparent window appears bottom-left of your screen.

It shows:

A circle gate with 24 colored ridges (each ridge = one possible movement angle).

A white dot in the center (neutral stick).

A red line showing your current stick direction.

Other Controls

ESC â†’ Quit the script.

When quitting, the joystick is reset so it doesnâ€™t keep drifting.

âœ… In short:

Use WASD for base movement.

Combine them for diagonals.

Add C or V to tilt into extra angles.

HUD shows you which way youâ€™re pointing.
